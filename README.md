# Flask Redis Quickstart
## Templates to do background magic ‚ú®
Example code that runs in the background asyncronously. Build things such as:

üåß **Weather app** that pulls weather data in the background

‚úÖ **Visualization platform** which runs large queries in background

üïπ **Programming tool** that programs Arduino's from a background process

Have you ever wanted to process an uploaded file asynronously? Or maybe you want to have a background process that updates data? Or maybe you just you want to have some variables that are shared between several python modules - this is the quickstart template for you!

## Getting started
**Clone this repository**

Download the git repository onto your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/sasha42/Flask-Redis-Quickstart.git
cd Flask-Redis-Quickstart
```

Set up python dependencies and install redis-server.
```
# Python
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Redis on linux
sudo apt-get install redis-server

```
cd basic-example
python app.py

You can now try out the example in your browser on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
